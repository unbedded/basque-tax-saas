# Place of Supply Rules - EU to Basque Country

> **Status**: Research in Progress
> **Last Updated**: 2026-01-19

## Overview

Place of supply rules determine which country's VAT applies to a transaction. This is critical for cross-border EU sales into Basque Country.

## General Principles

### Goods
| Scenario | Place of Supply |
|----------|-----------------|
| B2B with transport | Where transport ends (destination) |
| B2C below threshold | Where seller is established |
| B2C above threshold | Where goods are delivered |
| B2C (post-July 2021) | Where goods are delivered (€10k EU-wide threshold) |

### Services (General Rule)
| Scenario | Place of Supply |
|----------|-----------------|
| B2B | Where customer is established |
| B2C | Where supplier is established |

### Services (Exceptions for B2C)
Certain services are taxed where customer is located:
- Electronically supplied services
- Telecommunications
- Broadcasting
