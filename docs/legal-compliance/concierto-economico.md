# Concierto Económico (Basque Economic Agreement)

> **Status**: Researched
> **Last Updated**: 2026-01-19

## Overview

The **Concierto Económico** (Economic Agreement) is the unique fiscal arrangement between Spain and the Basque Autonomous Community. It grants the three Basque provinces (Historical Territories) extensive tax autonomy.

## Historical Background

- **1878**: First Economic Agreement approved after the 2nd Carlist War
- **Franco Era**: Suspended in Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa (remained in Álava)
- **1981**: Reinstated for all three provinces after Spain's democratic transition
- **2002**: Current legal framework established
- **2025**: Updated to include Pillar Two global minimum tax and other changes

## How It Works

### Fiscal Autonomy

The three **Diputaciones Forales** (Provincial Councils) have power to:
- Establish their own tax regulations
- Collect taxes from businesses and individuals
- Manage tax revenue independently

### The Three Provinces

| Province | Tax Authority | Key System |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Álava/Araba | Diputación Foral de Álava | TicketBAI |
| Bizkaia | Diputación Foral de Bizkaia | BATUZ |
| Gipuzkoa | Diputación Foral de Gipuzkoa | TicketBAI |

### "Cupo" (Quota) System

The Basque Country pays an annual quota to the Spanish state for:
- Services provided by the central government
- Contribution to general state expenses
- Non-transferred competencies

## Which Rules Apply?

### Determining Applicable Tax Jurisdiction

The key threshold is **turnover**:

| Turnover | Applicable Rules |
|----------|------------------|
| Below €12M (from 2026) | Based on headquarters location |
| Above €12M | Based on proportion of operations in each territory |

**Note**: Prior to 2026, the threshold was €10M.

### For Corporate Tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades)

A company is subject to Basque corporate tax if:
1. Headquarters (domicilio fiscal) is in Basque Country, AND
2. Annual turnover is below €12M, OR
3. 75%+ of operations are in Basque Country

### For VAT (IVA)

**Important**: VAT is a **harmonized EU tax** - rates are the same across Spain and Basque Country (21%, 10%, 4%).

However:
- Administration differs (may file with Basque or state authorities)
- TicketBAI/BATUZ reporting requirements are Basque-specific

## 2025 Updates

Key changes from April 2025 update:

1. **Pillar Two Compliance**: Global minimum tax transposed into Basque law
2. **Threshold Increase**: €10M → €12M for determining jurisdiction (effective 2026)
3. **New Taxes**: Authority to regulate additional taxes granted
4. **Financial Institution Tax**: Net interest and commission margin tax adopted

## Implications for Foreign EU Sellers

### Key Questions

**Q: Do Basque tax rules apply to foreign sellers?**

A: Generally, NO for most foreign EU sellers because:
- VAT rates are harmonized (same as rest of Spain)
- Foreign sellers typically use OSS or register with Spanish national authorities
- TicketBAI applies to businesses with **fiscal residence** in Basque Country

**Q: When might Basque rules apply?**

A: If you:
- Establish a permanent establishment in Basque Country
- Have fiscal headquarters in Basque Country
- Register for VAT through Basque authorities (rather than AEAT)

### Practical Guidance

For most cross-border EU sellers into Basque Country:
1. Use **OSS** (One-Stop Shop) for B2C sales
2. Apply **reverse charge** for B2B sales
3. File with your home country or Spanish national AEAT
4. TicketBAI **likely does not apply** (no fiscal residence)

## Differences from Rest of Spain

| Aspect | Basque Country | Rest of Spain |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| VAT Rates | Same (21%, 10%, 4%) | Same |
| Corporate Tax | Own rates/rules | National rates/rules |
| Personal Income Tax | Own rates/brackets | National rates/brackets |
| E-invoicing | TicketBAI/BATUZ | VeriFactu (coming) |
| Tax Authority | Diputaciones Forales | AEAT |
| Wealth Tax | Provincial variations | National rules |

## Key Takeaways for This Project

1. **VAT is harmonized** - no Basque-specific rates
2. **TicketBAI is territorial** - applies to Basque-resident businesses
3. **Foreign sellers typically file nationally** - via AEAT or OSS
4. **B2B reverse charge** - no difference from rest of Spain
5. **Consult specialists** if establishing presence in Basque Country
