# One-Stop Shop (OSS) and Import One-Stop Shop (IOSS)

> **Status**: Researched
> **Last Updated**: 2026-01-19

## Overview

The **One-Stop Shop (OSS)** is an EU-wide VAT simplification scheme that allows businesses to:
- Report and pay VAT for cross-border B2C sales in a **single return**
- Avoid registering for VAT in multiple EU countries
- File quarterly returns in their home Member State

## The €10,000 Threshold

### When OSS Becomes Relevant

Since July 1, 2021, EU sellers must charge **destination country VAT** when:
- Total cross-border B2C sales to **all EU countries** exceed **€10,000/year**
- This includes both goods and digital services

### Below Threshold

- May charge home country VAT rate
- No OSS registration required
- Optional: Can voluntarily register for OSS

### Above Threshold

**Must either:**
1. Register for OSS (recommended), OR
2. Register for VAT in each destination country

## OSS Scheme Types

### 1. Union OSS

**For**: EU-established businesses

**Covers**:
- B2C intra-EU distance sales of goods
- B2C supplies of services to consumers in other EU states
- Digital services to EU consumers

**Registration**: In Member State where business is established

### 2. Non-Union OSS

**For**: Non-EU businesses (no EU establishment)

**Covers**:
- Services supplied to EU consumers
- Digital services, consultancy, professional services

**Registration**: Choose any EU Member State

### 3. IOSS (Import One-Stop Shop)

**For**: Sellers of goods imported from outside EU

**Covers**:
- B2C sales of goods ≤€150 imported from non-EU countries

**Not relevant** for EU-to-Basque Country sales (no import)

## How OSS Works for Sales to Basque Country

### Scenario: EU Seller → Basque Country Consumer (B2C)

```
1. Customer in Basque Country places order
2. You charge Spanish VAT rate (21%, 10%, or 4%)
3. At quarter end, you file OSS return in YOUR country
4. Your tax authority collects total VAT
5. VAT is distributed to Spain (AEAT)
```

### Key Benefits

| Without OSS | With OSS |
|-------------|----------|
| Register in Spain | No Spanish registration |
| File Spanish VAT returns | Single return in home country |
| Deal with Spanish tax authority | Deal only with home authority |
| Multiple compliance obligations | Simplified compliance |

## Filing and Payment

### Quarterly Returns

| Quarter | Return Due | Payment Due |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Q1 (Jan-Mar) | April 30 | April 30 |
| Q2 (Apr-Jun) | July 31 | July 31 |
| Q3 (Jul-Sep) | October 31 | October 31 |
| Q4 (Oct-Dec) | January 31 | January 31 |

### What to Declare

- Sales amount per Member State
- VAT rate applied
- VAT amount per country
- Total VAT due

### Record Keeping

**Retain for 10 years**:
- Customer location evidence
- Invoices/receipts
- VAT rate documentation
- OSS filing confirmations

## Customer Location Evidence

For B2C digital services, you need **two pieces of non-contradictory evidence**:

| Evidence Type | Examples |
|---------------|----------|
| Billing address | Address provided by customer |
| IP address | Geolocation at time of sale |
| Bank details | Country of payment card/bank |
| SIM card | Mobile country code |
| Fixed landline | Country code of number |

## OSS and Basque Country Specifics

### Does OSS Cover Basque Country?

**YES** - OSS covers all of Spain, including Basque Country.

- Spain is the Member State of consumption
- No distinction between Basque provinces and rest of Spain for OSS
- VAT goes to Spanish national authority (AEAT)
- AEAT handles internal distribution

### TicketBAI and OSS

**TicketBAI does NOT apply to OSS sellers** because:
- OSS sellers are not fiscally resident in Basque Country
- TicketBAI applies to Basque tax residents only
- OSS is administered by national authorities, not provincial

## SaaS and Digital Services

### What Qualifies as Digital Services?

Per EU rules, electronically supplied services include:

| Included | NOT Included |
|----------|--------------|
| SaaS subscriptions | Goods ordered online |
| Software downloads | Hotel bookings |
| Streaming services | Services with human intervention |
| E-books | Live online tutoring |
| Online courses (automated) | Video conferencing |
| Cloud storage | Professional advice via email |

### Subscription Services via OSS

| Aspect | Treatment |
|--------|-----------|
| Monthly billing | Each month is a supply |
| Annual prepayment | Single supply when paid |
| Customer moves mid-subscription | Apply rate of new location |
| Free trial | No VAT until paid |

## Registering for OSS in Spain

If Spain is your Member State of establishment:

1. Access AEAT portal with digital certificate
2. Select OSS registration
3. Provide: NIF, business address, bank IBAN, target countries
4. File quarterly Form 369
5. Pay consolidated VAT to AEAT

**Note**: If established elsewhere in EU, register in your home country instead.

## When NOT to Use OSS

OSS is **not suitable** if:
- You only make B2B sales (use reverse charge instead)
- You have a fixed establishment in destination country
- You need to reclaim input VAT in destination country
- You make supplies not covered by OSS

## Comparison: OSS vs Local Registration

| Factor | OSS | Local Spain Registration |
|--------|-----|-------------------------|
| Simplicity | Simple | More complex |
| Number of returns | 1 quarterly | 4 quarterly (Spain) |
| Input VAT recovery | Not via OSS | Yes |
| Language | Home country | Spanish |
| Audit risk | Home country | Both countries |

## Key Takeaways

1. **OSS is the recommended approach** for B2C sales to Basque Country
2. **€10,000 threshold** applies to all EU cross-border B2C sales combined
3. **TicketBAI does not apply** when using OSS
4. **Digital services always use destination VAT** regardless of threshold
5. **Quarterly filing** with payment same day
6. **10-year record retention** required
