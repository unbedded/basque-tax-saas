## Basque vs National VAT

### Rates: Identical

VAT rates are **exactly the same** across:
- Álava/Araba
- Bizkaia
- Gipuzkoa
- Rest of Spain

### Administration: Different

| Aspect | Basque Country | Rest of Spain |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Tax authority | Diputaciones Forales | AEAT |
| E-invoicing | TicketBAI/BATUZ | VeriFactu (coming) |
| Filing system | Provincial systems | SII (national) |

**For foreign EU sellers**: This difference rarely matters because:
- B2B uses reverse charge (no VAT charged)
- B2C uses OSS (filed in home country)

## Applying the Correct Rate

### Decision Process

```
1. Identify what you're selling
   ├─ Physical goods → Check reduced/super-reduced lists
   ├─ Digital service → Usually 21%
   └─ Other service → Check exemptions, otherwise 21%

2. Identify customer type
   ├─ B2B with valid VAT → Zero-rate (reverse charge)
   └─ B2C → Apply Spanish rate per above

3. Apply rate
   └─ Charge correct % on invoice
```

### Common Scenarios for Cross-Border Sellers

| Scenario | Rate to Apply |
|----------|---------------|
| SaaS to Spanish consumer | 21% |
| SaaS to Spanish business | 0% (reverse charge) |
| Digital download to consumer | 21% |
| Online course to consumer | 21% |
| Consulting to business | 0% (reverse charge) |

## Recent and Upcoming Changes
